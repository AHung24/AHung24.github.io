<p>
    I am a graphic designer studying visual communications design at San Francisco State University. My goal is to use graphic design as a tool for marketing. It has become an outlet to express myself creatively. My university journey has been the ride of a lifetime. Starting at Biola University and returning to Skyline Community College to transfer to SF State University has taught me that change is inevitable in one's life.
